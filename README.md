  * __The build pipeline.pdf__ - High level overview of how C++ programs are being build. In other words - what happens after we click F5 in Visual Studio and before the console appears.
  
  * __Variables, types and the console.pdf__ - Covers the material we talked about during our first practice. It also has better structure, more examples and a few questions and coding tasks at the end.
