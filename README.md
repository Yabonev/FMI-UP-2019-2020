<h2 align="center"> Practices </h2>

 ### Practice 01

  * __The build pipeline.pdf__ - High level overview of how C++ programs are being build. In other words - what happens after we click F5 in Visual Studio and before the console appears.
  
  * __Variables, types and the console.pdf__ - Covers the material we talked about during our first practice. It also has better structure, more examples and a few questions and coding tasks at the end.
##
### Practice 02
      
  * __Variables and Modifiers.pdf__ - Deeper dive into variables, how are they represented in memory, how much memory they take, what are modifiers, when,why,how we use them, there are 5-6 coding tasks at the end of the file. DO THEM, please :)
  
  * __variables.cpp__ - The file we played around with during the practice related to variables.
  
  * __modifiers.cpp__ - The file we played around with during the practice related to modifiers.
  
  * __sizeOfTypes.cpp__ - The file shows how we can use the sizeof() function to see how much memory a variable or data type(with and without) modifiers take.
  
  * __rangeOnDifferentTypes.cpp__ - The file shows the ranges of different data types using the limits.h header, includes ranges for data types with modifiers.
  
  * __swap.cpp__ - Example program on how to swap the values of two variables of type int with and without a helper variable.
  ##
  ### Practice 03
   * __practice_3.pdf__ - Coding tasks for the third practice.
   * __taskXX.cpp__ - Solutions to all the tasks from the third practice.
  ##
  ### Practice 04
   * __bitwise-problems.pdf__ - Coding tasks for the fourth practice. Problems that require bitwise operators.
   * __bitwise-problems-expanded.pdf__ - Translated the tasks to Bulgarian and made them more bitwise beginner-friendly.
   * __visualizeBinaryNumbersWithBitset.cpp__ - Short example on how to visualize numbers in their binary format.
   * __task_XX.cpp__ - Solutions to some of the tasks from the fourth practice.
  ##
  ### Practice 05
   * __Loops.pdf__ - Coding tasks for the fifth practice. Problems mainly focus on for and while loops.

  ##
  ### Practice 06
   * __Functions and loops.pdf__ - Coding tasks for the sixth practice. The problems are from the fifth practice. They now require solutions with functions. A few new problems are also added.

  <h2 align="center"> Seminars </h2>
  
  ### Seminar 06
   * __what_is_function_and_how_do_I_create_one.pdf__ - Introductory explanation of what is a function in bulgarian.
   * __passing_parameters_by_reference.cpp__ - Example of passing variables by reference, mainly used as a reference(pun intended).
   * __arrays.cpp__ - Introduction to arrays and some basic operations with them. Contains lots of comments, also mainly used as a reference for what we talked about.

  <h2 align="center"> Homeworks </h2>
  
  ## Easy
  * ### Homework 01
    * __task_01.cpp__ - Solution for the first task using only integers and comparing with the == operator.
    * __task_01_commented.cpp__ - Same as above but with added comments explaining most of the logic, also has test cases.
    * __task_01_comparison_with_epsilon.cpp__ - Solution for the first task using floating point comparison with an epsilon.
    * __task_02.cpp__ - Solution for the second task.
    
  * ### Homework 02
    * __romanNumerals.cpp__ - Solution for the first task using functions to print the roman numerals.
    * __FMI_valute.cpp__ - Solution for the second task, also using functions to calculate some values.
   
  
  ## Hard
  * ### Homework 01
    * __darts.cpp__ - Solution for the task with input validations, usage of constant modifiers, etc.
    
  * ### Homework 02
    * __footballPerformance.cpp__ - Solution for hard homework 2. Autor Radoslav Hubenov, GitHub: @rrhubenov .
