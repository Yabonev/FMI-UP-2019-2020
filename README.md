## Practice 01

  * __The build pipeline.pdf__ - High level overview of how C++ programs are being build. In other words - what happens after we click F5 in Visual Studio and before the console appears.
  
  * __Variables, types and the console.pdf__ - Covers the material we talked about during our first practice. It also has better structure, more examples and a few questions and coding tasks at the end.
##
## Practice 02
      
  * __Variables and Modifiers.pdf__ - Deeper dive into variables, how are they represented in memory, how much memory they take, what are modifiers, when,why,how we use them, there are 5-6 coding tasks at the end of the file. DO THEM, please :)
  
  * __variables.cpp__ - The file we played around with during the practice related to variables.
  
  * __modifiers.cpp__ - The file we played around with during the practice related to modifiers.
  
  * __sizeOfTypes.cpp__ - The file shows how we can use the sizeof() function to see how much memory a variable or data type(with and without) modifiers take.
  
  * __rangeOnDifferentTypes.cpp__ - The file shows the ranges of different data types using the limits.h header, includes ranges for data types with modifiers.
  
  * __swap.cpp__ - Example program on how to swap the values of two variables of type int with and without a helper variable.

  ## Practice 03
   * __practice_3.pdf__ - Coding tasks for the third practice.
   * __taskXX.cpp__ - Solutions to all the tasks from the third practice.
  ##
  ## Practice 04
   * __bitwise-problems.pdf__ - Coding tasks for the fourth practice. Problems that require bitwise operators.
   * __bitwise-problems-expanded.pdf__ - Translated the tasks to Bulgarian and made them more bitwise beginner-friendly.
   * __visualizeBinaryNumbersWithBitset.cpp__ - Short example on how to visualize numbers in their binary format.
   * __task_XX.cpp__ - Solutions to some of the tasks from the fourth practice.
